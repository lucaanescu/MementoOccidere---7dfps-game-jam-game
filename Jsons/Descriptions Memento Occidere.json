	"Greetings, Miss Houghs.",
	"We are glad to have selected you for this assignment in advance. We know about your work at the great Straw front. While we wish we could have had more time to adjust you to this assignment we are unfortunately pressed for time and running low on funds. This will hopefully change soon.",
	"You might not know what kind of business we conduct, however what you must know is that one of our prime competitors is getting in the way of that business. We want him gone.",
	"Now as you know these types of weapons are accurate and very deadly but also very expensive and difficult to arm.",
	"This means that in the weapon we have provided you, there is a single round of refined Clearock.",
	"You have but one shot to take out the target we have assigned to you.",
	"He is a man that deals in replicant swords, he walks the streets past midnight. He has no friends in this area, and is known to have some marital difficulties from the locals.",
	"They do not wish to hear his troubles, but he will tell them regardless.",
	"Unfortunately this is all we know of him.",
	"We aren't worried, we know you are beastfolk and your excellent ears have the ability to hear from afar.",
	"Do not hesitate to listen in to get a more accurate mark selection.",
	"Do what you can with the resources we have given you. We expect you to handle this in the most upmost professional way.",
	"Yours truly.",
